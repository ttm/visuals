# README
visuals is handy to visualize data through images (matplotlib or d3js)
or animations (pymovie).

## Functionality
1) detect if data is heavy tailored through percolation
and plot appropriate histogram
OR
make histogram with bin with minimum_2,count/10^5; 0.01%)
2) Plot networks in specific order.
3) Hold plot sequence state in order to make sequences for stopmotion.
4) Ease integration from SparQL endpoints and the percolation package.
music and social also have some snippets.
